Watch Management - Feedback

- Cost & Org. Currency, should just be one column, Cost (with 2 currency displays like on Agent Balance) also display both in grid view.
- Batch Group is not being displayed on list.
- When you click Approve it should change the status to Approved in the interface
- Batch filter dropdown is not working / not matching with data
- Location filter dropdown is not working / not matching with data
- Had a watch that got stuck with AI description so i was not able to Reset AI on it, even after closing and opening it
- When you make new watch currency dropdown should be your default currency setting from Settings (both dropdowns should be same list also), or in Profile if you prefer the setting there.
